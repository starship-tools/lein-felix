# lein-felix

*A lein plugin for the Apache Felix OSGi project*

This project provides a Clojure `lein` plugin for working with Apache Felix
projects and performing OSGi tasks related to the OSGi framework.

Note that in addition to Apache Felix itself, this `lein` plugin relies heavily
upon the following (under the covers):

* [Mark Derricutt](https://github.com/talios)'s fork of [clojure.osgi](https://github.com/talios/clojure.osgi) (for which we are eternally grateful)
* The Apache Felix Project's [Maven Bundle Plugin](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html)


## Dependencies

This plugin shells out to the system and expects the following binary
executables to be on the system path or part of your system shell:

* `curl`
* `mkdir`
* `mv`
* `mvn`
* `unzip`
* `java`


## Default Values

The following is the default map used to create and interact with a local
install of Felix:

```clj
{:felix {
   :version "5.6.10"
   :download {
     :host "http://apache.claz.org"
     :dist-name "org.apache.felix.main.distribution"}
   :install-dir "felix"
   :bundle-dir "bundle"
   :jar "bin/felix.jar"
   :script {
      :install-dir "bin"
      :name "felix"}}}
```

These may be overridden in a map associated with the key `:felix` in a
`project.clj`' top-level, or in a project's `:profiles` section, also under
`:felix`.


## Usage

This plugin comes with its own help:

```
$ lein felix help
```
```
  Usage: lein felix [COMMAND]

  Supported commands:
